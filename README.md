# My-first-portfolio
This is my first portfolio website, created using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). It serves as a practice project, so there may be some informal elements. The purpose of this site is to help me improve my front-end development skills, particularly in HTML and CSS.
No AI was used in the creation of this website.
